It's been a while
-----

So I haven't made a portfolio or tried to have an online presence in a
long time. That lull in my career is over and over the next few years I
hope to create some interesting work under the public eye. I think it is
important to collaborate moving forward.

```JavaScript
class Main
  constructor : ( @type, @isDebug ) ->
    if @isDebug then return
    if !@type then return


```
