Every developer takes pride in the tools he uses to create his
applications. I am no different. I spent a lot of time using multiple
programs until I finally found a few that are my favorite.

For my primary development machine, I use a MacBook Pro. Apple still
does hardware magnificiently and I love the form factor on this machine.
I am a sucker for high resolution screens so the Retina display is one
of the main reasons I bought one in the first place. All of my software
is for the Mac but for the most part there are cross-platform
equivalents/alternatives.

MacVim
------

The classic VI editor for the Mac. It's extremely lightweight. Vi has been
around forever so the there is a large community. There is a steep
learning curve but you learn something new every day.

I recommend Janus to get started.

LiveReload
------

I think it is important to see an immediate response as a developer when
coding. My ideal set-up is a dual monitor (the more the merrier) with
VIM on one screen and [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) in the adjacent
screen. 

Github
------

Everybody's favorite. Important for source control and collaboration. Also, it is 
very easy to hook up with Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk. Allowing for snapshots and
quick scaling of web applications.
