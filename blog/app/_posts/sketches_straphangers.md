Introduction
-----

One of my favorite things to do is to sketch. I like to draw from life
and I am always challenged by drawing people. The C train is my
favorite environment to sketch in because not only the amount of
commuters but the diversity of the straphangers as well.

Drawing ability is, unfortunately, a lost art. It is the one pure act
where the mark I put down is unlabored. It further trains someone's visual
spatial intelligence adding to their ability to solve problems
creatively. Although I don't think it is necessary for a developer to be
a well-trained draftsmen. I do think the design process should be
incorporated in mosts developers' educations. Solving a complex visual
problem through a 2d (or even 3d) medium is a lot like building software
architecture.

Enough rambling here are a few select sketches from a book in which I
drew over 250 NYC commuters. Enjoy!
