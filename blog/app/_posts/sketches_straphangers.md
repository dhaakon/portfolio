![C Train](../images/c-train.jpg)

One of my favorite things to do is to sketch. I like to draw from life
and I am always challenged by drawing people. The C train is my
favorite environment to sketch in because not only the amount of
commuters but the diversity of the straphangers as well.

Drawing ability is, unfortunately, a lost art. It is the one pure act
where the mark I put down is unlabored.
